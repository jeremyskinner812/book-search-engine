# book-search-engine

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a full Mern stack application that utilizes an apollo server and graphql to store data. I built this to practice building out a functioning front end and back end with User authorization that uses React and Graphql. The application solves the problem of being able to search for books by various criteria and saving them for later. This will persist if you leave and log back in due to it being saved to your user profile. I learned a lot about how to connect the front and back end of the MERN application and to build the back end with an apollo server and graphql.
